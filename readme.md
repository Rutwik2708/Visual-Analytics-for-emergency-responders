# Disaster at St. Himark - Data Visualization Project

This project, completed as part of **CSE 598: Data Visualization** at Arizona State University, addresses the **2019 VAST Mini Challenge 1**. The project focuses on providing visual analytics to support emergency responders in prioritizing neighborhoods and assessing damage following a seismic event in St. Himark.

## Project Overview

Using **D3.js** and other JavaScript libraries, this dashboard synthesizes seismic data, citizen reports, and city infrastructure data to guide emergency planners. The visualization framework is based on the **Five Design Sheet Methodology**, promoting structured design and iterative development.

## Dashboard Features




1. **Choropleth Map and Bar Chart**
   Provides a comprehensive view of impacted regions, with user interaction features like detailed breakdowns upon clicking a neighborhood. The color saturation indicates severity, aiding quick prioritization.

2. **Violin Chart**  
   Visualizes the distribution of shake intensity across neighborhoods, enabling comparative analysis of seismic impact and report reliability.

3. **Interactive Pie Charts**  
   Illustrates missing data patterns across different utilities within neighborhoods, helping to assess the reliability of neighborhood reports.
